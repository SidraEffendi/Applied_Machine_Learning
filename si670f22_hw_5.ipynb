Please calculate the true probabilities in three bins: \\[0, 0.3), \\[0.3, 0.7), \\[0.7, 1\\]. You could further use these probabilities to draw a calibration curve but it's not required for this question. You only need to give the 3 numbers indicating the true probabilities for each bin.

    "### Question 2 (20 points) Cross-validation for very small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our lecture about data leakage, we talked about one simple strategy to help you avoid data leakage: before you do any work with a new dataset, split off a final test dataset, and use this final test dataset as the very last step in your validation. However, when you have a very small dataset, one issue is that it leads to really tiny test sets, which leads to unreliable test evaluation scores. For example, if you have a dataset with a total of 60 samples, and hold back 25% as a final test set, you'll get a final test set with 15 samples. In this case, a single evaluation score based on merely 15 samples could be very unreliable and probably not something to be relied on heavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make evaluation more reliable, we discussed how people usually use *cross-validation* to generate *multiple* evaluation scores, each on a different train/test split of the data. That is, you split the train and test set multiple times and then calculate the average of the resulting test scores. This is the approach we'll use to estimate a more reliable final test set score.  We don't want to use these final test sets to also tune our hyperparameters (to avoid data leakage), so we make sure to learn the model and tune the hyperparameters using only the data in the training split.  To do that, we do a second split *within the training data split* so that we have (i) a training set for the model and (ii) a separate *validation split* that's used to evaluate the model and pick the best setting for the hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the general recipe:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split the whole dataset into $k$ equal folds\n",
    "2. For $i$ from 1 to $k$   (for each of the $k$ folds)\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Take the $i$-th fold as a final test set. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. With the remaining data (i.e. combining the other folds), apply a standard train/test split (75%/25%).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. For each possible tuning value of hyperparameter (in our case, alpha):\n",
    "    \n",
    "       - Train the model with the 75% part using a specific hyperparameter choice (for alpha)\n",
    "             \n",
    "       - Evaluate the model with the 25% part. This 25% is our \"validation set\".\n",
    "             \n",
    "       Pick the hyperparameter value that gave the best score on the validation set.\n",
    "            \n",
    "    d. Once you find the optimal hyperparameter, do the test set predictions on this $i$-th fold and calculate the test score for this $i$-th fold.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. Report the average of the final test set scores you got across all $k$ folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate a small dataset scenario, we have provided the code that selects the first 60 samples from the built-in boston dataset.. We've also given you the variable 'alpha_list', which has the range of ridge regression hyperparameter alphe you should use for tuning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write the code that implements the above scheme on this subset of the boston dataset. You can split the whole dataset into k folds (step 1) by using the handy `KFold` function (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html). For each fold, you can then use the default `train_test_split` to get that's fold's training and validation data (step 2b). With this training data, train a Ridge regression model, and use the validation set to evaluate, tuning to find the optimal hyper-parameter alpha value within each fold (step 2c). Get the final test set score using this optimal model (step 2d). Repeat for all $k$ folds to obtain a set of final test scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you need to return the mean value of the $k$ final test scores. This is your final (more reliable) test set prediction."

    "For this question, we'll work with the Statlog (German Credit Data) dataset that classifies people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks. Download the dataset from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)) (Use the german.data). The last column is the prediction target and the remaining columns are features. \n",

    "(a) (20 points) First transform the categorical features into one-hot encodings. Then train a decision tree classifier and a random forest classifier. You should return 6 items as follows: the trained decision tree classifier, the trained random forest classifier, decision tree training accuracy, decision tree test accuracy,  random forest training accuracy, random forest test accuracy. **Please use random_state = 0 for train_test_split, decision tree classifier, and random forest classifier.**\n",

    "\n",
    "*Hint 2: You may have a problem using `OneHotEncoder` to handle string values and numerical values at the same time. You can transform the string columns first, and then concatenate with the numerical features.*\n",
